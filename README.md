# Getting Started (for developers)

You will need to install the following:
- Node.js
- Express
```bash
  npm install express
```
- Mongodb
```bash
  npm install mongodb
```

You will be basing your implementation off of the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/PnYCwfJO5FORCUykBZnejD/GDD-Content-Workflow-System?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=4xmmBjw7N0uJM9kW-0)
## Tech Stack
Front-End: HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js
Backend: MongoDB

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GDD-Toolkit/gdd-collab-system.git
```

Install dependencies in project directory

```bash
  npm install
```

Run the application

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Another way to run the application is via nodemon. This is a much better way because nodemon automatically updates your browser as file changes are detected:
```bash
  nodemon index
```
If you get a 'running scripts is disabled' error, run this in your console: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
